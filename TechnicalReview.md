Creating a complete technical PDF document, including design choices and system architecture diagrams, involves more detail than I can provide here in a single response. However, I can give you a template to help you structure your document. You'll need to fill in the details based on your specific implementation. This example assumes a blog CMS with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and related technologies.

# Technical Design Document for Distributed Blog CMS

## 1. Introduction

### Background and Project Overview
Our project aims to create a distributed Blog CMS using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and related technologies. The goal is to achieve scalability, high availability, and efficient content management.

### Purpose of the Document
This document outlines the technical design choices made during the development of the Distributed Blog CMS. It provides insights into the system architecture, database management, API modeling, high availability techniques, and more.

## 2. System Architecture

### Overview of the Entire System
The system is designed as a microservices architecture, utilizing Node.js for backend services and a MongoDB database. Frontend services are served by Nginx, ensuring efficient load balancing.

### High-Level Components
Components include frontend services, backend APIs, MongoDB clusters for data storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing.

### Relationships Between Components
Frontend communicates with backend APIs, which interact with the MongoDB clusters for data retrieval and storage. Redis is employed for caching frequently accessed data.

### Scalability and High Availability Considerations
The system is designed to be horizontally scalable, with MongoDB replication and sharding ensuring data availability and performance.

## 3. Database Management System

### Replication and Sharding
MongoDB replication is implemented for high availability, and sharding is employed to distribute data across multiple nodes.

### Database Schema Design
Efficient schema design ensures optimal storage and retrieval of blog content.

## 4. API Modeling

### RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs handle content upload, retrieval, and management. API endpoints are well-documented, following best practices.

## 5. High Availability Techniques

### Data Availability and Performance
Code and services are designed to enhance data availability and performance, ensuring a reliable user experience.

## 6. Caching and Sharding Implementation

### Caching
Redis is utilized for caching to reduce data retrieval latency.

### Sharding
Sharding strategies are implemented to distribute data across MongoDB clusters efficiently.

## 7. Scaling Distributed Applications

### Horizontal Scalability
The system is designed to scale horizontally to handle increased loads.

## 8. Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
Singleton pattern is employed for efficient management of database connections.

### Factory Pattern
Factory pattern is used for object creation.

## 9. Protect Against Common Web Scripting Vulnerabilities

### Input Validation
Input validation is implemented to prevent injection attacks.

### Authentication Mechanisms
Authentication mechanisms are in place for user logins.

## 10. Include Unit Tests and Integration Tests

### Testing Strategies
Unit tests and integration tests are included to ensure system functionality.

## 11. Folder and File Structure

### Project Structure
A well-organized folder and file structure is maintained, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

## 12. Docker Setup

### Dockerfiles and Compose
Docker setup includes Dockerfiles for frontend, backend, and Nginx, along with a Docker Compose file. Nginx is configured for optimal performance.

## 13. Conclusion

### Summary of Key Design Choices
The document concludes with a summary of the key design choices made during the development of the Distributed Blog CMS.

## 14. System Architecture Diagram

### Visual Representation
A visual system architecture diagram is included, providing an overview of the relationships between different components.
